4. Create an awesome name for your project space, and then select whether you want your project to be "Open and Discoverable" or "Private to the people I invite".  You can change this later.  I selected "Private" because sometimes I'm embarrassed about my code, or am working on a super top secret project.  Leave the rest of the selections as is right now.  Then press "Create".
